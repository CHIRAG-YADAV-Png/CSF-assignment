OVERVIEW ABOUT PROJECT :
A Portfolio Website is a personal web project designed to showcase an individual’s work, skills, achievements, and professional background in an organized and visually appealing way. The main purpose of this project is to create a digital identity where visitors—such as recruiters, clients, or collaborators—can easily learn about the creator and explore their projects.

In this portfolio website, multiple sections are included such as a Home page, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. These sections help present information clearly and make the website user-friendly. The project uses front-end web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the layout, structure the content, and add interactivity. CSS is used to style the pages, while JavaScript can be used for animations, smooth scrolling, form validation, and other dynamic features.

This project also focuses on responsiveness, ensuring that the website works properly on different devices like desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Additionally, the portfolio can be connected with Git and GitHub for version control, allowing easier updates and showcasing coding knowledge.

Overall, the Portfolio Website project not only highlights technical skills but also demonstrates creativity and presentation abilities, making it an essential tool for students, job seekers, and developers aiming to build a strong online presence.
